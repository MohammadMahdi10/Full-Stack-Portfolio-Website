# Full Stack Portfolio Website

## Summary
I developed a personal website as part of a module at Queen Mary University of London, showcasing both front-end and back-end development skills. The front end was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back end used PHP with a MySQL database to power a fully functional blog, login system, and admin system. Users can register, log in, and create blog posts, with all data securely stored, while the admin system provides management features. The site also highlights my achievements, education, and projects, serving as a portfolio to present my skills and experiences.
